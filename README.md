I made this Retail Store Sales Dashboard in Power BI with sample Data of a Store which I collected from Kaggle.
Problem Statement
To design a Retail Store Sales Dashboard that provides a clear and concise overview of the Store's Sales performance enabling the owner to gain actionable insights.

Report has Multiple Section's from where you can manage the Data, Like :

Report Data can be sliced by Quarter of Year to show Data of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4.

Report Data can also be sliced by State to show sales of any particular State.

It has cards showing Total Amount, Total Profit, Total Quantity of Sale.
